The main component of my research is data analysis using modern micro-econometric and price-theoretic tools. I aim to translate this main component into my teaching. I teach the basis for micro-econometric analysis at the Ph.D.-level in classes that combine theory, statistical software, and version control. More recently, I started to teach a Ph.D.-level class on applications of price theory to labor and development problems. Every other year, I host a reading group for advanced Ph.D. students, where we learn about recent developments in causal inference and policy evaluation. In the recent past, I enjoyed teaching classes at the undergraduate and master's levels on the economics of education.

## Econ 802-02: Advanced Economic Concepts and Applications: Price Theory---Ph.D. Course
This course discusses price theory applications as a continuation of the first-year price theory sequence of the Ph.D. program. Topics include education, models of the family, fertility, labor supply, and discrimination.

## Econ 899-02: Topics of Applied Econometrics (Econ Ph.D.)---Ph.D. Reading Group
This reading-group style class meets every other year. It studies advanced tools for causal inference and policy evaluation. The four modules study generalizations of standard uses of difference-in-difference, synthetic cohorts, instrumental variables, and dynamic panels models. Examples of the topics covered include difference in differences with variation in the timing of treatment, dynamic synthetic controls, identification of marginal treatment effects using instrumental variables, and moment estimators in panel settings.

## Econ 900-02: Econometrics, Module I---Ph.D. Course
This course provides a primer on graduate-level regression analysis. The course covers mathematical, statistical, mechanical, and computational intrinsic details of linear regression. The course offers several empirical applications. It provides version control and statistical-software training. I did not teach this class in the Fall of 2022. I will teach it again in the Fall of 2023.

## Econ 900-03: Econometrics,  Module II---Ph.D. Course
This course provides an introduction to empirical design for causal inference. Building on the material of Econ-900-02, it discusses methods for policy evaluation and identification of causal effects. The course offers several empirical applications. It provides version control and statistical-software training. I did not teach this class in the Fall of 2022. I will teach it again in the Fall of 2023.
