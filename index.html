Welcome. 
<br>
<br>
I am an associate professor at the Department of Economics of Texas A&M University.
<br>
<br>
I am a labor economist investigating the economic fundamentals driving the efficiency and effectiveness of social policies that tackle poverty in the US and developing countries. Some of my work also uses tools of development and public economics. My research aims to contribute to a better understanding of child and female human capital development and well-being.
