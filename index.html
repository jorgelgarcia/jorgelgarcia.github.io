Welcome.

<br>
I am an associate professor at the Department of Economics of Texas A&M University.
<br>
<br>
My work is on applied microeconomics. I use tools of labor, public, and development economics to investigate the economic fundamentals driving the efficiency and effectiveness of social policies that tackle poverty in the US and developing countries. My research aims to contribute to a better understanding of child and female or maternal human capital development and development.
