I am an applied micro-economist aiming to generate scientific knowledge that contributes to creating socially efficient public policy for effectively tackling poverty, both domestically and internationally. My work uses tools of labor, public, and development economics to investigate the economic fundamentals driving the efficiency and effectiveness (or lack thereof) of social policies.
