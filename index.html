Welcome. 
<br>
<br>
I am an associate professor at the Department of Economics of Texas A&M University.
<br>
<br>
I am a labor economist investigating the economic fundamentals that drive the efficiency and effectiveness of social policies addressing poverty in the US and developing countries. Some of my work also applies tools from development and public economics. My research aims to enhance understanding of human capital development and the well-being of children and their parents, especially their mothers.
