I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of labor and development economics. My research focuses on education, fertility, and labor force participation. I explore how these choices' market and policy environments shape socio-economic inequality. The subjects of my current projects are women in developing countries and disadvantaged women and their children in the United States.
