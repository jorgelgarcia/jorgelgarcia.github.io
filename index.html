<b>Welcome to my website</b>. 
<br>
<br>
I am an assistant professor at the John E. Walker Department of Economics of Clemson University, currently on leave as a visiting assistant professor at the Sol Price School of Public Policy of the University of Southern California. In Fall 2024, I will join the Department of Economics of Texas A&M University as an associate professor.
<br>
<br>
My work is on applied microeconomics; it uses labor, public, and development economics tools to investigate the economic fundamentals driving the efficiency and effectiveness of social policies that tackle poverty in the US and developing countries.
